# Project 1: XMPP chat

Welcome to my first project for the course **Computer Networks** at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala.


## Project description
This project uses the XMPP protocol, and each student had the freedom to choose the language in which to implement it. 
This project is developed in  🐍 Python 🐍 3.11.4, primarily relying on the slixmpp library. 
The client is implemented in CLI (Command Line Interface), and it's recommended to use the Visual Studio Code CLI as it has implemented colors for this CLI. 
The server used was provided by the course instructor, and the domain was **@alumchat.xyz**.


## Libraries 📚
Below, I list the libraries I used along with their versions.

### External libraries:
* `aioconsole                0.6.2`
* `aiofiles                  23.2.1`
* `slixmpp                   1.8.4`
* `xmpppy                    0.7.1`

### Internal libraries
* `time ⏰`
* `base64 🔢`


I chose  🐍 Python 🐍 because I wanted to learn how to program concurrently. Additionally, the book used for the course covers everything in  🐍 Python 🐍. 
Concurrent programming is a challenge, the learning curve is quite steep, but I believe it's necessary to learn it.
